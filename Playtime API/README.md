# Important!
To use this API for yourself, you'll need to set your Steam Web API key (Yes, an API in an API, it's complicated.) in a file called ".env" using the following format:
```
# .env
STEAM_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```
If you do not have this file in the same directory as the API server, the API will **not** work.

Other than that, have fun.
